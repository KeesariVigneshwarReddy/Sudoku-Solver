The Sudoku Solver project is a Java-based application designed to solve Sudoku puzzles of varying complexity levels using recursion and backtracking.

### Know what is a sudoku

Sudoku is a classic number puzzle game that challenges players to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids (referred to as "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9 without repetition. 

### Aim
This project aims to provide an efficient solution to automatically solve Sudoku puzzles, making use of algorithmic techniques. 

Most importantly, I have assumed that a unique solution exists for a sudoku.

## Running Tests

Here is an example of test case.

```bash
Input : 
0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0
4 9 0 1 5 7 0 0 2
0 0 3 0 0 4 1 9 0
1 8 5 0 6 0 0 2 0
0 0 0 0 2 0 0 6 0
9 6 0 4 0 5 3 0 0
0 3 0 0 7 2 0 0 4
0 4 9 0 3 0 0 5 7
8 2 7 0 0 9 0 1 3

Output :
Solution exists
2 1 8 3 9 6 7 4 5 
4 9 6 1 5 7 8 3 2 
7 5 3 2 8 4 1 9 6 
1 8 5 7 6 3 4 2 9 
3 7 4 9 2 8 5 6 1 
9 6 2 4 1 5 3 7 8 
5 3 1 6 7 2 9 8 4 
6 4 9 8 3 1 2 5 7 
8 2 7 5 4 9 6 1 3 
```
